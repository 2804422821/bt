**Bt** is a lightweight framework for P2P-lovers and enthusiastic BitTorrent researchers, perfect choice for light enterprise and home usage and experimentation. It offers good performance, reliability and is highly customizable. With Bt you can create a production-grade BitTorrent client in a matter of minutes. Bt is still in its' early days, but is actively developed and designed with stability and maintainability in mind.

[CLI Launcher](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/bt/tree/master/bt-cli)

## Release 1.1

Release 1.1 includes a number of major performance and algorithmic improvements, critical bug fixes and API enhancements. Full list is available in [release notes](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/bt/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.txt). **It's strongly recommended for all users to switch to 1.1.**

## Support for BEP-5: DHT Protocol

Available in [dht-experimental](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/bt/tree/dht-experimental) branch. It's stable and already includes all changes from the 1.1 version.

## Building from source

1) Clone the git repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/bt.git
```

2) Fetch and checkout dht-experimental (if you'd like to have DHT support)
```
git fetch
git checkout dht-experimental
```

3) Build
 ```
 mvn clean install -Plgpl -DskipTests=true
 ```
 
4) Download with CLI wrapper or use as a library
```
java -Xmx64m -jar bt-cli/target/bt-launcher.jar -f <path-to-torrent-file> -d <download-dir>
```

## Usage

Declare the following dependencies in your projectâ€™s **pom.xml**:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.atomashpolskiy</groupId>
    <artifactId>bt-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.1</version>
</dependency>
<!-- for the sake of keeping the core with minimum number of 3-rd party 
     dependencies HTTP tracker support is shipped as a separate module;
     you may omit this dependency if only UDP trackers are going to be used -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.atomashpolskiy</groupId>
    <artifactId>bt-http-tracker-client</artifactId>
    <version>1.1</version>
</dependency>
<!-- bt-dht will be available if you've built the project manually 
     from dht-experimental branch-->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.atomashpolskiy</groupId>
    <artifactId>bt-dht</artifactId>
    <version>1.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

## Code sample

```java
// enable multithreaded verification of torrent data
Config config = new Config() {
    @Override
    public int getNumOfHashingThreads() {
        return 8;
    }
};

// enable bootstrapping from public routers
Module dhtModule = new DHTModule(new DHTConfig() {
    @Override
    public boolean shouldUseRouterBootstrap() {
        return true;
    }
});

// get torrent file URL and download directory
URL torrentUrl = getTorrentUrl();
File targetDirectory = getTargetDirectory();

// create file system based backend for torrent data
Storage storage = new FileSystemStorage(targetDirectory);

// create client with a private runtime
BtClient client = Bt.client()
        .config(config)
        .storage(storage)
        .torrent(torrentUrl)
        .autoLoadModules()
        .module(dhtModule)
        .build();

// launch
client.startAsync(state -> {
    if (state.getPiecesRemaining() == 0) {
        client.stop();
    }
}, 1000).join();
```

## What makes Bt stand out from the crowd

### Flexibility

Being built around the [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) DI, **Bt** provides many options for tailoring the system for your specific needs. If something is a part of Bt, then it can be modified or substituted for your custom code.

### Custom backends

**Bt** is shipped with a standard file-system based backend (i.e. you can download the torrent file to a storage device). However, the backend details are abstracted from the message-level code. This means that you can use your own backend by providing a _storage unit_ implementation.

### Protocol extensions

One notable customization scenario is extending the standard BitTorrent protocol with your own messages. BitTorrent's [BEP-10](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0010.html) provides a native support for protocol extensions, and implementation of this standard is already included in **Bt**. Contribute your own _Messages_, byte manipulating _MessageHandlers_, message _consumers_ and _producers_; supply any additional info in _ExtendedHandshake_.

### Test infrastructure

To allow you test the changes that you've made to the core, **Bt** ships with a specialized framework for integration tests. Create an arbitrary-sized _swarm_ of peers inside a simple _JUnit_ test, set the number of seeders and leechers and start a real torrent session on your localhost. E.g. create one seeder and many leechers to stress test the network overhead; use a really large file and multiple peers to stress test your newest laptop's expensive SSD storage; or just launch the whole swarm in _no-files_ mode and test your protocol extensions.

### Parallel downloads

**Bt** has out-of-the-box support for multiple simultaneous torrent sessions with minimal system overhead. 1% CPU and 32M of RAM should be enough for everyone!

### Java 8 CompletableFuture

Client API leverages the asynchronous `java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture` to provide the most natural way for co-ordinating multiple torrent sessions. E.g. use `CompletableFuture.allOf(client1.startAsync(...), client2.startAsync(...), ...).join()`. Or create a more sophisticated processing pipeline.
