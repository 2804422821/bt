[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atomashpolskiy/bt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atomashpolskiy/bt) [![Javadoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/javadoc-latest-blue.svg)](http://atomashpolskiy.github.io/bt/javadoc/latest/)

**Bt** is a lightweight framework for P2P-lovers and enthusiastic BitTorrent researchers, perfect choice for light enterprise and home usage and experimentation. It offers good performance, reliability and is highly customizable. With Bt you can create a production-grade BitTorrent client in a matter of minutes. Bt is still in its' early days, but is actively developed and designed with stability and maintainability in mind.

## What makes Bt stand out from the crowd

### Flexibility

Being built around the [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) DI, **Bt** provides many options for tailoring the system for your specific needs. If something is a part of Bt, then it can be modified or substituted for your custom code.

### Custom backends

**Bt** is shipped with a standard file-system based backend (i.e. you can download the torrent file to a storage device). However, the backend details are abstracted from the message-level code. This means that you can use your own backend by providing a _storage unit_ implementation.

### Protocol extensions

One notable customization scenario is extending the standard BitTorrent protocol with your own messages. BitTorrent's [BEP-10](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0010.html) provides a native support for protocol extensions, and implementation of this standard is already included in **Bt**. Contribute your own _Messages_, byte manipulating _MessageHandlers_, message _consumers_ and _producers_; supply any additional info in _ExtendedHandshake_.

### Test infrastructure

To allow you test the changes that you've made to the core, **Bt** ships with a specialized framework for integration tests. Create an arbitrary-sized _swarm_ of peers inside a simple _JUnit_ test, set the number of seeders and leechers and start a real torrent session on your localhost. E.g. create one seeder and many leechers to stress test the network overhead; use a really large file and multiple peers to stress test your newest laptop's expensive SSD storage (pun intended); or just launch the whole swarm in _no-files_ mode and test your protocol extensions.

### Parallel downloads

**Bt** has out-of-the-box support for multiple simultaneous torrent sessions with minimal system overhead. 1% CPU and 32M of RAM should be enough for everyone!

### Java 8 CompletableFuture

Client API leverages the asynchronous `java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture` to provide the most natural way for co-ordinating multiple torrent sessions. E.g. use `CompletableFuture.allOf(client1.startAsync(...), client2.startAsync(...), ...).join()`. Or create a more sophisticated processing pipeline.

## Code sample

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {

  URL metainfoUrl = getMetainfoUrl();
  File targetDirectory = getTargetDirectory();
  
  // create file system based backend for torrent contents
  Storage storage = new FileSystemStorage(targetDirectory);
  
  // create client with a private runtime
  BtClient client = Bt.client(storage).url(metainfoUrl).standalone();
  
  // launch
  client.startAsync(state -> {
      if (state.getPiecesRemaining() == 0) {
          client.stop();
      }
  }, 1000).join();
}
```
