----------------------------------
Release: 1.3
Date:
----------------------------------
Official BEPs:

* BEP-9: Extension for Peers to Send Metadata Files

Changes/New Features:

* Added ByteRange for working with binary ranges based on byte arrays and byte buffers
* Support creating torrents from binary representation of info dictionary

Bug Fixes/Improvements:

* Introduced notion of torrent processing chain
* Fixed bug in extended protocol (invalid message type id mapping for peers) that sometimes prevented peers from receiving extended messages from Bt
* Reduced dependency on the presence of a torrent; using torrent ID where possible

----------------------------------
Release: 1.2
Date: 05/24/2017
----------------------------------
Changes/New Features:

* Message Stream Encryption
* Added API for retrieving the full list of registered torrents

Bug Fixes/Improvements:

* Last block in a chunk is incorrectly marked as complete even when partially written
* Provide info on encryption support, local TCP port and version in extended handshake
* Eliminate self-connections in tests
* Don't specify the recipient of a PEX message in the list of added peers

----------------------------------
Release: 1.1
Date: 04/10/2017
----------------------------------
Changes/New Features:

* Support for auto-loading modules from the classpath
* Enhanced API for building standalone and shared-runtime clients
* Streaming (continuous) piece selectors
* Improvements in piece selection and peer assignments algorithm
* Support for multi-threaded hashing (verification) of torrent data on startup
* Lifecycle binding API improvements; support for asynchronous bindings
* Tools for creating custom protocol tests

Bug Fixes/Improvements:

* Torrent processing should not terminate when interaction with the tracker failed
* Announce key can be missing in trackerless torrents
* Failures on receiving unexpected blocks should be optional
* Peer connection occasionally stopped receiving/sending data due to a buffer compaction bug
* Verification tasks should be submitted only for complete pieces
* Chunk descriptor overlapping two files contained no blocks when the latter file was smaller than the leftovers from the former file
* Calculate total size for multi-file torrents
* NPE on UDP message worker shutdown
* Multi-tracker does not announce to next trackers in tier if an exception was thrown
* Querying trackers and other peer sources should be async
* Adaptive message processing interval in message dispatcher to reduce the CPU load
* Speed-up the initial startup by skipping verification if a storage unit is empty and by feeding larger blocks to the digester

----------------------------------
Release: 1.0
Date: 01/16/17
----------------------------------
Features:

* Bencoding parser/encoder
* Validation of arbitrary bencoded documents according to user-provided object models and YAML schemas

* URL metainfo fetcher, support for providing custom metainfo fetchers
* HTTP and UDP tracker integration
* Multi-tracker support
* Private tracker support
* Standard bittorrent protocol and messaging
* Full support for protocol extensions, including customization of handshake procedure
* Support for providing custom peer sources
* Peer exchange (protocol for p2p exchange of known peers in the swarm)
* Support for custom messaging agents (consumers and producers), both for standard and extended protocols
* Sequential, rarest-first and randomized rarest-first piece selection strategies
* Shared runtime with multiple simultaneous torrent sessions
* Test infrastructure with support for launching peer swarm on localhost to test new features in a real environment
