/**
 * Each torrent is split into chunks (also called "pieces").
 *
 * A chunk is a part of the torrent's collection of files,
 * possibly overlapping several files (in case of multi-file torrents)
 * or being just a part of a single-file torrent.
 *
 * There is a SHA-1 checksum for each chunk in the torrent's metainfo file,
 * so it's effectively an elementary unit of data in BitTorrent.
 * All chunks in a given torrent have the same size
 * (determined by {@link Torrent#getChunkSize()}),
 * except for the last one, which can be smaller.
 *
 * A typical chunk is usually too large to work with at I/O level.
 * So, for the needs of network transfer and storage each chunk is additionally split into "blocks".
 * Size of a block is quite an important parameter of torrent messaging,
 * and it's usually client-specific (meaning that each client is free to choose the concrete value).
