title: Release 1.4
---


Release 1.4 was published to Maven Central on August 14th, 2017. 

It is mostly a maintenance release with some important bug fixes. We've also refactored `FileSystemStorage` to not depend on `java.io.File` and instead use `java.nio.file.Path`. This paves the way for some interesting possibilities, one of which is using [Jimfs, an in-memory file system for Java 7+](https://github.com/google/jimfs) to emulate in-memory file storage.

#### Changes/New Features:

* Choose a specific network interface [#20](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/bt/issues/20)

#### Bug Fixes/Improvements:

* Use generic java.nio.files interfaces in FileSystemStorage [#21](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/bt/issues/21) -- [Jeremy L. Morris (MorrisLaw)](https://github.com/MorrisLaw)
* Switch integration tests to using in-memory storage [#27](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/bt/issues/27)
* UDP tracker request contains 0 as the listening port
* Download not starting when using standalone client with private runtime [#34](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/bt/issues/34)
* java.lang.IllegalAccessError when running inside JBoss modules [#32](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/bt/issues/32)
