title: Release 1.5
---


Release 1.5 was published to Maven Central on September 26th, 2017. There are several cool features in this release.

### Runtime events

The new centralized mechanism for publishing/receiving events is represented by two DI services: `bt.event.EventSink` for publishing and `bt.event.EventSource` for subscriptions. Library users have an easy access to the `EventSource` instance via `bt.runtime.BtRuntime#getEventSource()`. 

Currently there are the following types of events:
- when a new peer has been discovered for some torrent;
- when a new connection with some peer has been established;
- when a connection with some peer has been terminated;
- when local information about some peer's data has been updated (received BITFIELD or HAVE message);
- when processing of some torrent has begun;
- when processing of some torrent has finished;

### Torrent processing listeners

This is mostly an internal enhancement, but it brings two useful features for library users:

1) Ability to **stop torrent processing as soon as the metadata has been fetched.** It can be convenient, when one is using magnet links and doesn't want to download the actual data, but just the _info dictionary_. See `bt.TorrentClientBuilder#afterTorrentFetched`.

2) Ability to **stop torrent processing as soon as the data has been downloaded**. It is supposed to replace the custom listeners, that periodically perform `state.getPiecesRemaining() == 0` checks and then invoke `client.stop()`. The new alternative is much more efficient, because it does not use a separate thread. See `bt.TorrentClientBuilder#stopWhenDownloaded`.

### I/O selector

Leveraging OS I/O multiplexing allowed to significantly reduce the number of system calls and slightly cut down on the CPU usage in message dispatching loop.
 
### Module extenders

This feature is borrowed from [Bootique](http://bootique.io/) project (which I strongly recommend to anyone, who is interested in runnable Java applications). It replaces _contribution methods_ with a clearer and more concise API for contributing custom extensions into the core. Instead of invoking individual contributions methods, downstream modules should now call `bt.module.ServiceModule#extend(Binder)` or `bt.module.ProtocolModule#extend(Binder)` and use methods in the returned builder instance, e.g.:

```java
import com.google.inject.Binder;
import com.google.inject.Module;

import bt.module.ProtocolModule;

public class MyModule implements Module {
    
    @Override
    public void configure(Binder binder) {
        ProtocolModule.extend(binder)
            .addMessageHandler(20, ExtendedProtocol.class)
            .addExtendedMessageHandler("ut_metadata", UtMetadataMessageHandler.class);
    }
}
```

### ...and more
