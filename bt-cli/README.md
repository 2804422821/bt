# Simple command-line torrent downloader

This module contains a simple CLI launcher for **Bt**.

**NOTE #1**: Currently, all peer connections are established via [encryption negotation protocol](http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Message_Stream_Encryption) (also called MSE handshake). Therefore, in order to be able to connect to peers you must install [Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html). The reason for this requirement is that the [MSE RC4 cipher](http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Message_Stream_Encryption) uses 160 bit keys, while default Java installation allows at most 128 bit keys.

**NOTE #2**: Currently, the CLI launcher can only work in headless mode under _Windows_. This mode is activated, if `-H` command line argument is present. GUI will be disabled, but you'll still be able to find out what's going on by inspecting the logs in current working directory.
